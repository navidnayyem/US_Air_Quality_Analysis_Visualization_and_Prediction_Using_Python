People's health is directly impacted by air quality. Numerous respiratory disorders, heart disease, and even early mortality have all been related to poor oxygen levels. To successfully address this issue, air quality measurements and studies are required. Python will be used to assess and visualize the US air quality. Government organizations created the Air Quality Index (AQI) to indicate to the public how unhealthy the air is right now or is predicted to be. AQI is linked to elevated levels of air pollution and harm to the public's health. The Air Quality Index (AQI) provides information on air quality. Additionally, it exposes the purity and potential health risks of our air. AQI is a unit of measurement on a scale from 0 to 500. Greater air pollution and related health hazards are associated with higher AQI values. For instance, a score of 50 or less on the AQI scale denotes good air quality, a score of 300 or more denotes dangerous air quality brought on by pollution, and a score of less than 100 is typically regarded as good. The air is deemed unhealthy for people who are most at risk of health impacts when AQI measurements are above 100, and for the entire community when AQI readings are above 150. The project will utilize the **"US Air Quality 1980-Present"** dataset available on **Kaggle** (dataset link provided above). This dataset contains air quality data from 1980 to May 2022 of the US. Along with geographic coordinates latitude and longitude, this dataset contains data on Date, AQI, Category, Defining Parameter - PM2.5 (particulate matter), PM10, Ozone, Carbon Monoxide, Sulfur Dioxide, or Nitrogen Dioxide, Number of Sites Reporting, city ascii, state id, state name, population, density and time zone. We will be working on data for two years from May 2021 to May 2022.

**The following methods and tools that will be used in this project are:**

<ol>
  <li>Python programming language for data analysis, visualization, and prediction. </li>
  <li>Panda-Numpy for data manipulation analysis. </li>
  <li>Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for static visualization and interactivity. </li>
  <li>Time-series analysis techniques for trend identification and forecasting. </li>
  <li>The category of Air Quality Index (AQI) will be classified. </li>
  <li>Accuracy measurement using metrics like Root-Mean-Square Deviation (RMSE) for regression, or appropriate metrics for classification if needed. </li>
  <li>Apply or create machine learning models like Scikit-Learn for predicting US air quality and accurately forecast AQI values in the US. </li>
